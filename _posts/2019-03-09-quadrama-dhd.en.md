### Classification of eponymous characters in German dramas and evaluation based on Lessing's "Emilia Galotti"

We follow the idea of a quantitative and at the same time multi-dimensional categorisation of dramatic characters and attempt to automatically classify eponymous characters in German dramas. We formulate the problem as a classification task which can be realised using machine learning approaches. Furthermore, we make use of features such as uttered tokens, presence on stage, network metrics, topic modelling and various meta data. This way, we are able to show that our multi-dimensional model yields reasonable results on the classification of eponymous characters: MCC of 0.66. Eponymous characters are being retrieved very reliably (Recall 1.00), but the model tends towards over-generalisation. We evaluate the results of our classifcation using the example of Lessing's *Emilia Galotti*.

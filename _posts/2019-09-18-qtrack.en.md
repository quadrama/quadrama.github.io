Weâ€™re pleased to announce that QuaDramA will receive additional funding soon. In this extension called Q:TRACK, we will investigate knowledge about social relations in drama, focusing on family relations. The core idea is to track the distribution and dissemination of social knowledge by detecting the knowledge characters have, acquire and share during the course of dramatic action. In order to accomplish this, Q:TRACK combines methods from computational linguistics and digital humanities with theoretical and historical expertise of literary studies. The project builds on the research we have done in QuaDramA so far.

Q:TRACK is funded within the [DFG Priority Programme Computational Literary Studies](https://dfg-spp-cls.github.io) and will officially start in Spring 2020.

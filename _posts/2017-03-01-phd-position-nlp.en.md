# About QuaDramA
We investigate dramatic figures in German theatre plays from 1750 until 1900. We will combine and integrate qualitative, hermeneutic approaches with quantitative, computer-aided text analysis. The project aims at a) a new perspective on drama history and b) new methods and tools for the processing of dramatic texts on a large scale (you'll find more about this project on [our web page](http://quadrama.github.io)).

- Master-level degree in computational linguistics or natural language processing.
- Coreference resolution and domain adaptation will be the focusses of the NLP part of the project. Interest in these areas is presumed, past experiences are a plus.
- Willingness to learn or proficiency in Java, [Apache UIMA](https://uima.apache.org), [R](https://www.r-project.org)
- Good command of the German language

## General requirements
- Willingness to learn, apply and reflect upon new methods and workflows
- Interdisciplinary communication skills
- Participation in regular local meetings
- Ability to work in a team, interest in literary studies
- Read, discuss and publish in English or German
- Readiness to share project-related interim results publicly
- Experiences in the digital humanities is a plus


# Graduating and working at Stuttgart University
The PhD thesis should be related to the project and will be advised locally. Prof. Dr. Jonas Kuhn (Natural Language Processing) is available as a supervisor.

Stuttgart University offers ideal conditions for doctoral students, including for research in the area of Digital Humanities (that are represented with an original Master's program). The so-called *Stuttgarter Weg* represents the interdisciplinary integration of engineering, natural sciences, humanities and social sciences, and is encoded in the overall university concept. QuaDramA is one example of this concept.

## Technical Appendix


### Figure Speech Statistics

```R
library(DramaAnalysis)
library(jsonlite)

t <- load.text(c("vndf.0", "r0px.0", "rksp.0"),
               tokens = TRUE)
t <- limit.figures.by.rank(t)

fstat <- figure.statistics(t, names=TRUE)

mat <- matrix(data=c(fstat[,3]),ncol=3)
colnames(mat) <- c(
      "Romeo und Julia (Ü: Schlegel)",
      "Die Familie Schroffenstein",
      "Emilia Galotti")
mat <- apply(mat, 2,
    function(x) {sort(x, decreasing=TRUE)})

# Plotting in R
# create the plot
barplot(mat, beside=FALSE, col=qd.colors, border=NA, ylab = "Tokens")
# add labels to some figures
text(x=c(0.7,0.7,1.9,1.9,3.1),
    y=c(mat[1,1]/2, sum(mat[1,1]+mat[2,1]/2),
        mat[1,2]/2, sum(mat[1:2,2])+mat[3,2]/2,
        sum(mat[1:4,3])+mat[5,3]/2),
    labels=c("Romeo", "Julia", "Ottokar", "Agnes", "Emilia"),
    col=c("white"))


# Export into json (for visualisation above)
ranks <- tapply(fstat$tokens, INDEX=fstat$drama, FUN = rank)
for (i in seq(1:10)) {print(toJSON(fstat[fstat$rank==i,1:3]))}
# copy-paste and do some manual editing (adding commas etc.)
```

### Utterance Length Variation

```R
library(DramaAnalysis)
library(jsonlite)

id <- "vndf.0"

text <- load.text(c(id), tokens=TRUE)
text <- limit.figures.by.rank(text)
ustat <- utterance_statistics(text, num.figures = F)

# Plotting in R
boxplot(ustat$utterance_length ~ ustat$figure,
          col=qd.colors, las=2,frame=F,
          main=paste("Figure Utterances"))

# Export to json
bp <- tapply(ustat$utterance_length, INDEX = ustat$figure, FUN = function(x) {boxplot.stats(x)})
toJSON(bp)

```

We are exited to announce the release of a new corpus called GerDraCor-Coref! The corpus comprises of over 30 dramatic texts (both full texts and single acts), coming from [GerDraCor](https://www.dracor.org/ger) and manual coreference annotations on these texts. With this corpus, we aim to further study the relationship of coreference and dramatic texts and the way dramatic characters refer to each other. GerDraCor-Coref is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/quadrama/gerdracor-coref). A publication describing the corpus and performing different analyses on the data has been published at the [2020 LREC conference](http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2020/pdf/2020.lrec-1.7.pdf).

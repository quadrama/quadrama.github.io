We are happy to announce that QuaDramA will soon be funded by the [Volkswagen Foundation](http://www.volkswagenstiftung.de), as part of the funding initiative on [Mixed Methods in the Humanities](https://www.volkswagenstiftung.de/mixedmethodsgeisteswissenschaften.html).

We are thankful to the Volkswagen Foundation and are looking forward researching dramatic texts through both qualitative and quantitative lenses. We are currently planning to officially start in April 2017. Two positions for PhD students will be announced shortly.

On October 5th the second project phase of QuaDramA has started under the name Q:Track. Supported by the DFG priority program [Computational Literary Studies](https://dfg-spp-cls.github.io/), we will focus our research on the character knowledge of social relations in dramatic worlds. "We" is our previous team and our new team member [Melanie Andresen](https://quadrama.github.io/people.de#melanie-andresen). Four hours were enough to distribute tasks for 3 years (at least!).
- [x] Work packages distributed - check!
- [x] First text selection - check!
- [x] Cooperation partners - check!
- [x] Worsphop planning - check!
- [x] Special issue planning - check!
- [ ] Group photo with mask - Oh crap...

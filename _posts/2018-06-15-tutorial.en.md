On Monday, June 18, we will give a tutorial about the [DramaAnalysis R package](https://github.com/quadrama/DramaAnalysis) for students at Heidelberg university.  **The slides can be accessed [here](/assets/2018-06-15-tutorial/slides.html).**

Since this is actually the first time we are doing this, we take it at a starting point for collecting tutorial materials in [this repository](https://github.com/quadrama/tutorial). The raw files for this tutorial are in the sub directory `intro-90` (since it's a 90 minutes slot).

## Call for Papers

The gradual establishment and consolidation of Computational Literary Studies in light of ever larger digital text corpora highlights that computational methods for analysing and subsequently interpreting literature are becoming increasingly important and prominent. Above all, this concerns the potentials of a higher-scaled view on literary history that is being promised by the simultaneous analysis of thousands of literary texts. As part of the big tent that Digital Humanities has evolved into over the last 20 years, quantitative drama analysis has become one of the pillars of Computational Literary Studies with many essential studies laying out groundwork, e.g., regarding the application of social network analysis on literature (cf. Moretti 2011, Trilcke 2013). Quantitative drama analysis has a long lasting history (e.g., Yarkho 2019 [1929/1938], Reichert 1965 or Marcus 1973 [1970]) that is based on the same genre-specific characteristics of dramatic texts that nowadays make it appealing for automatic computational analyses: dramas are structured into primary and secondary text, scenes and acts and all of its character speech is labeled. These structural qualities allow for straightforward formalisations that would require extensive preliminary work in narrative texts.

Building on the lessons of the past and the insights of current research, the planned workshop intends to depict the status quo of computational drama analysis: What achievements have been realised, what challenges still need to be overcome and what opportunities arise for quantitative drama analysis in the future? To answer these questions, the workshop aims to bring together scholars working or critically reflecting on formal, quantitative or digital methods for the analysis of drama. On the one hand, we want to discuss the current state of computational drama analysis – which methods have proven successful, which findings can be fed back into hermeneutical interpretation? On the other hand, we aim at opening up new perspectives for the future and exploring possible routes computational drama analysis could take.

 The following topics are of particular interest:
- Application of computational methods for drama analysis, such as topic modeling, stylometry, network analyses, sentiment or emotion analyses with a view to research questions of literary studies
- Critical reflection of these applications, in particular with respect to requirements, generalizability or interpretability
- Development and application of language processing methods to character speech or stage directions
- Exploring potentials for drama history with corpus-based analyses or classifications
- Relationship of quantitative analyses with findings, foundations or presuppositions in literary studies
- Strategies for efficient corpus creation from scanned books to expressive XML collections
- Exploitation of linked open data and metadata analysis for drama analysis

We invite the submission of abstracts (1 page) on any of the above mentioned or closely related topics. A decision on the acceptance to the workshop will be made based on these abstracts by the workshop organizers. Submissions are non-blind. Prior to the workshop, accepted abstracts need to be extended into full papers (5000-6000 words) and the results will be presented and discussed at the workshop. After the workshop, the revised full papers will be published in workshop proceedings. Further details on the proceedings will follow shortly.
For the specific deadlines, please see the timeline below.

Please send your abstract in PDF format to [janis.pagel@uni-koeln.de](mailto:janis.pagel@uni-koeln.de).

## Venue

The workshop will take place on-site at the University of Cologne, Germany. Further details on the venue will follow soon.

QuaDramA -- Quantitative Drama Analytics -- is a research project [we]({{ site.baseurl }}/about.en) currently conduct at [Stuttgart University](http://www.uni-stuttgart.de/). The aim of the project is the development of new methods to analyse dramatic texts and the investigation of drama-historic developments using these new methods. The core idea of QuaDramA is the complementation of analysing structural information (e.g., acts and scenes) with an NLP-supported analysis of the figure speech.

QuaDramA is attached to the [Center for Reflected Text Analytics](http://www.creta.uni-stuttgart.de) and the [Stuttgart Research Center for Text Studies](http://www.ts.uni-stuttgart.de).

QuaDramA aims to extend the possibilities for large-scale analysis of dramas focusing the dramatic figure. More than 600 German dramas, mainly from 1740 to 1920, will be examined by integrating structure analysis with content analysis of the figure speech. This integration is enabled by the use of tools for natural language processing (NLP), which are domain-adapted to this specific text type. The planned integration is not a trivial task, because speech content and dramatic structure are very different sources of information that need to be analysed jointly and in a systematic way in order to provide added value for the literary interpretation. The project will empirically analyse different aspects of figures in dramas and relate empirical findings to existing drama-historic theories. 
Specifically, three related aspects of drama figures will be investigated:

1. *Figure Types*: What techniques do playwrights employ to distinguish figure types (Gentle Father, Intriguer, Jester etc.)? Is it possible to Identify figure types automatically and how do these figure types develop over the history of drama?
2. *Interactions* between Figures: How do figures (and figure types) interact with other figures (and figure types)? What are their relations based on (emotions, family or social obligations, etc.)? Can we identify prototypical relation patterns over multiple figures in specific historical constellations?
3. *Development* of Figures: How do figures and figure types develop within a single drama?

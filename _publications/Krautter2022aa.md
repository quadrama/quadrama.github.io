### Abstract
This chapter investigates the relationship between interpretative literary character types, such as the schemer, and descriptive character properties, such as gender, age, and social status. This relationship is crucial to studying dramatic characters quantitatively across a corpus of plays, as both properties and types can be used to guide a rational comparative or diachronic analysis. To this end, we first discuss the principles of character types in drama history and theater practice, connect them to gender, age, and social status, and finally discuss their possible operationalization using machine learning.

### Abstract
Starting from a detailed reconstruction of Martin Mueller’s theoretical conceptualization of scalable reading, the article focuses on the practical implications that scalable reading has on (computational) literary studies. Based on an extensive analysis where the concept is structured in four different dimensions that are important to understand the idea of scaling, I will examine the practical consequences that scalable reading can have when analyzing literature. For this, I will examine different forms of literary network analysis of German plays and analyze them in light of the various dimensions of scaling. Doing so, I illustrate how qualitative and quantitative methods in literary studies can be brought together in a fruitful way.

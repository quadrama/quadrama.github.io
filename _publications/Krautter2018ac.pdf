### Abstract
Quantitative methods of text analysis can be applied not only to large corpora but also to individual literary texts in order to sharpen their understanding. Due to its comprehensive function, the figure speech in drama seems particularly suitable for contextualizing different methods of digital analysis and thus opening up the results to broader questions. In the course of a drama, it seems to be crucial to critically compare insights from structural as well as semantic and stylistic data. The results established for Lessingâ€™s Minna von Barnhelm suggest that the co-presence of characters is crucial for the analysis of character speech.

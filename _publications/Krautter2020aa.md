### Abstract

This article deals with the operationalization of character types in German-language drama. Based on literary and theatre history, we identify characters that belong to one of the three types: ›schemer‹, ›virtuous daughter‹ and ›tender father‹. For the characters in our corpus, property-based data sets were established, which are then used in turn for their automatic classification. In addition to the complexity of characters and the theoretical determination of character types, we discuss the methodological challenge of generalizing from a small set of annotations. Our experiments show that the selected types emerge as definable subsets within a population.

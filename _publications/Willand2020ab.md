### Abstract
In this paper we explore over a hundred plays to investigate Shakespeare’s Impact on German Drama. We compare eighteenth-century works with translations of Shakespeare and with the contemporary critical (poetological) discourse surrounding the relative merits and demerits of their formal composition. We find that the plays of the Sturm und Drang best represent Shakespeare's influence. But we also find that Sturm and Drang plays are not as innovative as they are usually seen (because of their deviation of the place and time poetics) - at least in a formal manner, they are strongly oriented towards rule based poetics.
